# 📦 all-repos

A shared, reusable index and workflow file for use across **all repositories**.

This document is intended to live in a central repo (such as `starter-project-`) and act as a **single source of truth** for organization, progress tracking, and conventions.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

- Provide a consistent structure across repositories
- Track work at a high level (not per-repo details)
- Document conventions, philosophy, and workflow
- Avoid duplication in individual READMEs

This file intentionally **does not list specific repositories**.

---

## 🧭 Scope

Applies to:
- Starter / template projects
- Experiments and prototypes
- Documentation-only repos
- Long-running and short-lived work

Does **not** override:
- Repo-specific README files
- Repo-specific LICENSE files

---

## 🗂 Repository Conventions
